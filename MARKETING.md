# SmartProBono Pocket — Marketing Assets

## App Store Description (Short, Non-Inflammatory)

**SmartProBono Pocket** helps you stay calm and take the right steps during legal or law enforcement interactions.

Think of it as AAA for legal situations. One tap launches Safety Mode: your location is shared with a trusted contact, and you get simple, step-by-step guidance designed to reduce stress and keep things calm.

- One-tap Safety Mode
- Share your location with emergency contacts
- Calm, on-screen guidance for different situations
- No legal jargon. No lecturing. Just support when you need it.

Set up your emergency contact once, and you're ready. Works when you're pulled over, calling for help, or in other stressful legal moments.
